# blue-carbon-db

This repositiory contains two Qiime2 formatted databases for examining the origins of carbon stocks from sediment along with the scripts used to create them. 
Two databases have been generated using data avalible from the NCBI, one for the plastid gene rbcl and one for 18S rRNA gene of molluscs. 

These custom reference sequence databases were generated and curated using RESCRIPt in the Qiime2 environment. 
The owners of this repository are not the developers of RESCRIPt or Qiime2, you can find more information on those platforms and plugins here:
